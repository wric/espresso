An app for enhancing the experience when using Lelit MaraX. The app will show stats combined from the internal serial controller, an added reed sensor to determine pump state, and the weight from a Wilfa Svart bluetooth scale.

The backend consists of two parts; the Wilfa scale and the MaraX internals (pump + serial). The frontend displays current state and a graph with the temperature history of 120 seconds.
